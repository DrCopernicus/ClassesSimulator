ClassesSimulator
================
Intended for generating class schedules with friends. Highly experimental and may not work as intended. Future updates will increase user-friendliness, simulation speed, and robustness in general.

Example classes.csv included. Generates output.csv when run. Settings hardcoded, so this will not run out of the box (you'll have to change the settings in the code).
